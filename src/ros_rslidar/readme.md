#### 1. Prerequisites
(1) Install a ubuntu PC. We suggested Ubuntu 14.04 or Ubuntu 16.04. Please do not use virtual machine.
(2) Install ros full-desktop version. We tried Indigo and Kinect.

####  2. Install
(1). Copy the whole rslidar directory into ROS workspace, i.e "~/catkin_ws/src".

(2). Checkt the file attributes:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/ros_rslidar/rslidar_drvier
chmod 777 cfg/*
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/ros_rslidar/rslidar_pointcloud
chmod 777 cfg/*
```

(3). Then to compile the source code and to install it:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```
#### 3. Configure PC IP
By default, the RSLIDAR is configured to **192.168.1.200** as its device IP and **192.168.1.102** as PC IP that it would communicate. The default port is 6677 as RSLIDAR tele port number, while 6699 as the data port on the PC.
So you need configure your PC IP as a static one **192.168.1.102**.

#### 4. Run and view realtime data
We have provide an exmaple launch file under rslidar_pointclodu/launch, we can run the launch file to view the point cloud data.
(1). Open a new terminal and run:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch rslidar_pointcloud rs_lidar_mems.launch
```

(2). Open a new terminal and run:

```
rviz
```
Set the Fixed Frame to "**rslidar**".
Add a Pointcloud2 type and set the topic to "**rslidar_points**".

#### 5. About the lidar data
Under "**rslidar_pointcloud/data**" directory, you can find the lidar data files for the exact sensor. By default the launch file "rs_lidar_mems.launch" load the three files: 
- rslidar_pointcloud/data/rs_lidar_mems/real_slow_axis.csv
- rslidar_pointcloud/data/rs_lidar_mems/ChannelNum.csv
- rslidar_pointcloud/data/rs_lidar_mems/limit.csv.
